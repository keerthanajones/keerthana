    <div class="col-sm-4"><p>MovieTickets.com is an online movie ticketing website founded by AMC Theatres and Hollywood.com in 2000 with National Amusements, CBS Corporation and Famous Players all coming on board prior to launch.[1] It is now a joint venture between the Hollywood Media Corp, National Amusements, Cineplex Entertainment, Marcus Theatres, Regal Entertainment Group, Viacom, and Time Warner.[2] MovieTickets.com provides movie times for all theaters, and online ticket purchasing for all National Amusements theaters and all Clearview Cinemas, among other smaller chains; such as Mann Theatres in Los Angeles. In 2010, MovieTickets.com sold over 16 million tickets for over 200 exhibitors with 14,000 screens.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4" ><p>In 2004, MovieTickets.com became the exclusive online ticket vendor for Moviefone.com, after having entered in a partnership in 2001 that crosslinked their ticketing offerings.[5] Then, in mid-2005, MovieTickets.com established a ticket distribution relationship with consignment ticket reseller PrintTixUSA, adding 20 movie exhibition companies to its ranks and boosting the total number of screens serviced nationwide to more than 10,000.[6] Since then, however, MovieTickets.com has lost ground, losing sole rights to the AMC chain and Moviefone's telephone arm to rival Fandango.</p></div>

<p>A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film, or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.</p></div>
